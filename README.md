(Originally from the repository [Utilities-and-Mockups](https://github.com/cluster-coder/Utilities-and-Mockups/tree/main/Garen%20Ult%20Comprehension)) 

I was playing a character from the game League of Legends, in this game you can kill other players by reducing their HP bar to zero.  
Garen has an ability that does some base number + the enemy's missing health as damage, and I wanted to know/have a raw notion of when to use this ability, this is the purpose of this mockup
